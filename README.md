## Is RoR Dead?

To answer this question, I need to study in more detail the internal structure and all the charms of the RoR framework. Ruby on Rails is a tool that helps to quickly and efficiently implement the functionality that the customer wants. But like any tool, it can become a device that helps to do work more sophisticated and faster, or become a dangerous weapon. To understand the difference and also has some benefits: maintainability, readability, elegance, faster development, DRY code.

## AWS Basics

Amazon Web Services launched in 2002 is the market leader in IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) for cloud ecosystems, which can be combined to create a scalable cloud application without worrying about delays related to infrastructure provisioning (compute, storage, and network) and management.
With AWS you'll find a complete set of highly available services which is designed to work together to build sophisticated scalable application delivered over the internet.
You'll have on-demand access to highly durable storage, low-cost compute, high-performance databases and the tools to manage these resources all available with upfront costs only pay for what you use.

## Personal development

Focus on work, identifying my most productive hours throughout the day, and completing my most important tasks during those hours. Correct formulation of the problem and look at the problem from different angles, rethinking the task. Breaking the task down into small parts and setting the correct priorities for their implementation.

## Google Cloud
(Google Cloud information)[v2/GoogleCloud.md]

### ‚å®Ô∏è Typing Speed - 50wps

Typing on the keyboard should be like breathing - precise and fast at the right moments.  
Blind typing helps you focus on your work without thinking about the keys or looking at the keyboard. It will also help avoid spelling errors that are difficult to track down and not tracked in the IDE.

### üåê English - Intermidiate

English, English, English it is needed everywhere and one of the most important thing in this roadmap.

## Light talk [Presentation](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1T61sRWjAKVdSf6jlRJIaghVjSOiUqa8-wAnbWTd1uDI/edit?usp=sharing)

The main idea is to tell the audience something interesting from their own experience (for example, a hobby, a new technology, a previous trip) in 20-30 minutes. This presentation should not be very technical - so that it is interesting for all employees of the company.

### üó£Ô∏è Presentation topic: **Linux is everywhere ‚Äì Facts everyone should know**

What device are you reading this article on?

If it happens to be an Android smart device, you are using a machine running Linux at its core. The majority of web servers, including ours that is serving you this page, and cloud infrastructure are Linux-based as well. ‚ÄúSo, what is Linux, some piece of internet software?‚Äù the uninitiated might ask.

Well, Linux isn‚Äôt found just in your smartphone or on the internet, it‚Äôs probably present in your car as well, be it an Audi, Honda, or Mercedes. Not impressed yet?

How about this ‚Äì all of the world‚Äôs top 500 supercomputers use Linux as their OS. It also powers most of the software behind the US Department of Defense, Amazon, Instagram, and Wikipedia, to name just a few.

So, is Linux an operating system? Yes, Linux it is one of the most powerful operating systems in the world! And it powers much more of the global technology than most people give it credit for. Linux is clearly much more present in our lives than we realize, but it tends to get overshadowed by its bigger, older cousins Windows and Macintosh. As a result, relatively few people know much about it, and some have never even heard of it.
