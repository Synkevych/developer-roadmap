## Is RoR Dead?

To answer this question, I need to study in more detail the internal structure and all the charms of the RoR framework. Ruby on Rails is a tool that helps to quickly and efficiently implement the functionality that the customer wants. But like any tool, it can become a device that helps to do work more sophisticated and faster, or become a dangerous weapon. To understand the difference and also has some benefits: maintainability, readability, elegance, faster development, DRY code.

Amazon Web Services launched in 2002 is the market leader in IaaS (Infrastructure-as-a-Service) and PaaS (Platform-as-a-Service) for cloud ecosystems, which can be combined to create a scalable cloud application without worrying about delays related to infrastructure provisioning (compute, storage, and network) and management.
With AWS you'll find a complete set of highly available services which is designed to work together to build sophisticated scalable application delivered over the internet.
You'll have on-demand access to highly durable storage, low-cost compute, high-performance databases and the tools to manage these resources all available with upfront costs only pay for what you use.

### Typing Speed

Typing on the keyboard should be like breathing - precise and fast at the right moments.  
Blind typing helps you focus on your work without thinking about the keys or looking at the keyboard. It will also help avoid spelling errors that are difficult to track down and not tracked in the IDE.
